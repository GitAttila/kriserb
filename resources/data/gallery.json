    "portfolio_description_en":"<p>The photographic project &quot;Moondust&quot; is about finding nocturnal places, connecting them with the inner landscapes of feelings and revealing them in the unseen, yet real light. The lonely wandering through space amplifies the author’s sense of perception, sharpening the senses as she switches to an intuitive and instinctual level. She herself offers the following explanation: &quot;I am like a hunter waiting for a movement, for the ideal composition, for an interesting shape or flash of light that suddenly appears in the darkness. I never know what the photographs will look like. I never see clearly.&quot; Working in the dark, she seeks out original, strange and unusual places and discovers what the world might look like if we could see in the dark.In &quot;Moondust&quot; the author is fascinated by untamed nature, but also by places whose aesthetic recalls the surface of other astronomical objects. On her wanderings, she randomly encounters rotting bodies, abandoned shells or animal bones. These symbols of life and death do not horrify her – instead, she intensely feels the ever-present finality of life in all its naturalness as an integral part of all life. The author’s solitary nature is thus imprinted into contemplative and mysterious images that form a counterpoint to reportage or documentary photography. The found objects, structures or landscape motifs – or, on some occasions, people as well – are personal reflections of the atmosphere of the places she visits. At the same time, an important role in her work is played by the return to natural wildness, by the experience of personal freedom, by an acceptance of death as a fact of life and by an awareness of unity within the order of the universe.</p>",

Here and now, in the silence, sharing time and space, the quietness and the inner suspense. The rawness of the now.</p><p>Yet, I never see clearly. I am like a hunter, waiting for the ideal shape to appear, intuitively searching for the perfect composition. And I never see the people as they are.

My friend Anežka, who became the centre of my interest, is at the age when her thoughts and emotions change, and her experiences are very strong and immediate.</p><p>Being with her allows me to recall my own childhood and its transformation into adulthood, and to feel again the moments of fear, confusion and loneliness. She has an affectionate relationship with nature and gratitude for everyday things, but she also deals with an increasing defiance towards authority, along with fear of death and loss.</p><p>The cooperation with her offers both aesthetic moments for portraiture in the form of authentic gestures and also empathetic insight into the elapsing time of childhood, which I can observe and capture but which I cannot stop or take back.</p>",
